# TagPro Player Count
This is a simple extension that tracks the player count of the various TagPro servers. It allows users to be aware of the player count on their favorite server without visiting the TagPro server page.

## How to use
This project should be installed as a Chrome extension. Once the extension has successfully loaded, it should be visible in the upper-right corner of Chrome windows. To select which server to use, right-click on the icon and select `Choose Server to Track`->`Track X`.

Every minute, the extension will query the chosen server and display the number of players in the text around the extension icon.

To play a game, simply left-click on the icon and you will be directed to the game finding screen for your chosen server.
